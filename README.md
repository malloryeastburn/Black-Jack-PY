100 Days of Code: Day 10!

Program: Create a simple, text-based game of black jack.

Attemping this project with a new challenge I'm calling "Blind Coding".

I will code this project 100% without any resources or help(such as: google, stackoverflow, discord, etc).
Simply using my brain.

Goal: Improve my knowledge of python syntax and become more hireable!
